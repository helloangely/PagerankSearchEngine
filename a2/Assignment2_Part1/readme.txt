The task for the first part of our assignment was to calculate scores for our text documents. We decided to take an object-oriented approach as showed to us in lecture. 
A special feature we added to get more precise calculations, was to take into account that periods used for abbreviations such as Dr., Ms., Mrs., and Mr. in the content and subtract that from the number of sentences that are returned. To get the number of syllables in the document, we got the difference of the diphthongs and vowel counts. We used a for loop and kept track of the previous letter and the current letter to figure out how many diphthongs there are in the document and if the letter in question is a vowel. We had two counters to keep track of the number of vowels and diphthongs. We used a corpus reader to find the number of sentences, so we thank nltk for providing this feature. To calculate the CL and FK score, we used the functions in our class to make these calculations. The advantage to our program by using object oriented programming, is that you can easily analyze multiple documents by slightly altering the code.   

The results for the testing were reasonable. We added additional test documents for our added features.
